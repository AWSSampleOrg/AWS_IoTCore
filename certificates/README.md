# You might need to register your certificate authority (CA) with AWS IoT if you are using client certificates signed by a CA that AWS IoT doesn't recognize.

[See details on AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/manage-your-CA-certs.html)

1. If you wanna register your CA using CLI, just execute `cli.sh`
2. See above docs if you wanna use console
